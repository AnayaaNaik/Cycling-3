        <p> Each person has different hobbies, and doing different things gives them joy. Cycling is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax. I tried cycling after entering 2nd standard. At first, it was a little stressful, but then I started learning more and more.Another thing that helps me relax is painting. I started painting when I was in 3rd standard, and over the years, the habit is something that has helped me learn a lot.

My parents have always supported my dreams and aspirations. According to them, the only way to achieve all your goals is to work very hard and never give up on them.Instead, they wanted me to choose my careers and a life that will give me joy and stability.
